## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are
user/order variables – and item variables. order\_id, product\_id,
add\_to\_cart\_order, reordered, user\_id, eval\_set, order\_number,
order\_dow, order\_hour\_of\_day, days\_since\_prior\_order,
product\_name, aisle\_id, department\_id, aisle, department

How many aisles and which are most items from?

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Lets make a plot

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle), 
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  )%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Lets make a table

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(product_name) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>%
  filter(rank < 4) %>%
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>%
    knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Apples vs ice cream

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream"))%>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
pivot_wider(
  names_from = order_dow, 
  values_from = mean_hour
)
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

## Problem 2

Loading the dataset

``` r
accelero_data = read_csv(file = "./Data/accel_data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Tidying and wrangling the dataset

``` r
accelero_data = janitor::clean_names(accelero_data) %>%
                pivot_longer(
                   activity_1:activity_1440,
                   names_to = "activity_for_minute",
                   values_to = "activity_count") %>%
  separate(activity_for_minute, c("word", "minute_of_the_day"), "_") %>%
  select(-word) %>%
  mutate(
    day = factor(day, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
        )%>%
  mutate(day_type = case_when(day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday") ~ "Weekday",
                              day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday") ~ "Weekend")
        )
accelero_data
```

    ##     week day_id day    minute_of_the_day activity_count day_type
    ##    <dbl>  <dbl> <fct>  <chr>                      <dbl> <chr>   
    ##  1     1      1 Friday 1                           88.4 Weekday 
    ##  2     1      1 Friday 2                           82.2 Weekday 
    ##  3     1      1 Friday 3                           64.4 Weekday 
    ##  4     1      1 Friday 4                           70.0 Weekday 
    ##  5     1      1 Friday 5                           75.0 Weekday

    ##  7     1      1 Friday 7                           53.8 Weekday 
    ##  8     1      1 Friday 8                           47.8 Weekday 
    ##  9     1      1 Friday 9                           55.5 Weekday 
    ## 10     1      1 Friday 10                          43.0 Weekday 
    ## # … with 50,390 more rows

The variables in the data are week, day\_id, day, minute\_of\_the\_day,
activity\_count, day\_type. There are 50400 rows (observations) and 6
columns in the dataset. The number of rows or observations signifies
activity count for each minute of the day for each day of the week for 5
weeks (35 days).

Making a table of total activity for each day of the week

``` r
accelero_data %>%
  group_by(week, day) %>%
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_count)) %>%
 knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

He tends to have more physical activity during the weekdays than the
weekends for the first couple of weeks. Later his activity on weekends
increases. However, during the Saturdays of the 4th and 5th weeks, he
had barely any activity. They could have been rest days.
